# Forecasting-Time-Series-AMZ-stock-price
Forecasting time series in Python.        
In this project our goal is to forecast the close price of AMZ stock for the next years        
Splitting ou data into training and testing set, and using different models for forecasting : SARIMA, FB Prophet, LSTM RNN and XG Boost           
Comparing the models based on their performance (MSE and RMSE) to find which one gives the best results and the accurate predictions on our test set
